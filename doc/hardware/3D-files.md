# 3D-Files
The file to print are all in this [repository](https://github.com/M-A-P-Organisation/3D-files).
## Separation
The M-A-P is based in 2 parts, one for the arduino and one for the raspberry pi, the second one placed on top of the first.

They both have been designed on blender, printed as stl on an anycubic i3 mega.
